# HFhashcracking
This repository is for a left list of MD5 hashes that have gone uncracked for some time.
With a bit of effort, I have managed to obtain: Recovered........: 15093/421991 (3.58%) and still counting. 
Who can recover the most? Bring this list to its knees.

The shortest one in the file so far:
ee3f728021b1ef5d2b9f496fe9b64a77:Mzip161.ru (10 characters)

The longest:
ec6cf5f3551cc2f26d0685e6eeae982a:commanderlogisticsgroupwesternpacific@americanmilitarynews.com (62 characters)

I do not know or care where these hashes have come from, we are just flexing our minds in finding ways to crack as many as we can.
